                <p class="leftAlign">Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.<br><br> 
                    Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.<br><br> 
                    Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

                <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island.<br><br>
                    Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. <br><br>
                    Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (<em>helmets are required by law</em>).<br><br>
                    Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
