                    Most tourists spend most of their time in <span class="smallCaps">Taniti City</span>,<br> 
                    which boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay.<br><br> 
                    Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.

                    Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano.<br><br>
                    However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling.<br><br>
                    Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year.<br><br>
                    Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>
